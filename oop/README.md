### Task

Please create a `shiny` application that collects rates / votes in both numerical (e.g. `1-5`) and factor (`"good"`, `"medium"`, `"bad"`) types. Use `S3`, `S4` and `R6` OOP systems.

### Solution

An example solution is available here. Please navigate to `run.R` scripts that sources all the other scripts. You will find multiple app calls using different OOP systems. Please look into the other scripts for details.
